# 🧺 Analysis of Basic Food Basket Prices in Campinas-SP (2022–2025)

This extension project aims to analyze the evolution of basic food basket prices in the city of Campinas-SP, Brazil, using data science techniques, unsupervised learning, and interactive data visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Investigate price variations of basic food items between 2022 and 2025.
- Identify patterns by product, vendor, and time.
- Apply the KMeans clustering algorithm to detect behavioral trends.
- Communicate insights through dashboards and visual reports.
- Provide data to support public policy and social actions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: data analysis and modeling (Jupyter/Colab)
- **Pandas, NumPy**: data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: static visualizations
- **Scikit-Learn**: data scaling and clustering (KMeans)
- **Power BI**: interactive dashboards
- **Excel**: initial data organization

## 🔍 Key Analyses
- **Distribution of prices and PPK** (price per kilogram)
- **Boxplots per product** to detect outliers
- **Line charts** by product category (basic and animal-based)
- **Monthly price evolution** from 2022 to 2025
- **Annual cost estimation** of the full basic basket
- **Clustering** using KMeans to identify two main price behavior profiles

## 📌 Highlights
- The estimated total cost of the basic food basket increased from ~R$280.00 in 2022 to ~R$350.00 in 2025.
- Products like **tomatoes** showed high price volatility.
- Vendors with systematically higher or lower pricing were identified.
- Visualizations showed seasonal variations and inflationary impacts.
